# WeatherStation
Weather station is a system that uses a BBC micro:bit microcontroller, along with external sensors and a carrier board to measure and record weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, and rainfall.
# B4B Weather Extension

A MakeCode extension for micro:bit to support the **B4B Weather Station Kit**.

Features:
- Read sensors (Soil moisture, Light, DHT11 Temp/Humidity, BMP280 Temp)
- Display values on a **4-digit TM1637 7-segment display**
- Blocks for individual sensors or automatic cycling

## Blocks
- **Init 7-seg display CLK DIO**
- **Show number on 7-seg**
- **Show [sensor] on 7-seg**
- **Cycle all sensor values on 7-seg**

## Usage
```blocks
B4B_Weather.initDisplay(DigitalPin.P8, DigitalPin.P9)
B4B_Weather.showSensor(B4B_Weather.SensorType.Temp)
```

## Notes
- TM1637 driver is provided.
- Sensor read functions use mock values or micro:bit inputs; connect real modules for actual data.
